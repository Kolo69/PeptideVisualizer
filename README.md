# PeptideVisualizer
The PeptideVisualizer is an open-source cross-platform software solution for visualization of proteins in proteomic datasets based on the coverage of mass spectrometry identified peptides.
The principle originates from the original PROTOMAP publication (Cravatt et al., Cell. 2008). PeptideVisualizer enhances PROTOMAP analysis by incorporating additional quantitative information, protein features visualization and reliable mismatch factor.

Whole version history is available, but only tle latest version or version available @ www.proteome.eu should be used.
